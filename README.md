Massive credit given to [DulkirMod](https://github.com/inglettronald/DulkirMod/), [Skytils](https://github.com/Skytils/SkytilsMod), and [SkyblockAddons](https://github.com/BiscuitDevelopment/SkyblockAddons) for being great open-source examples to figure out utility and features form

## Features (few)

### Useful
- Dominus Stack Timer
- Auto Send Positional Messages
- Title For Positional Messages
- Title for Melody Messages
- Customizable Relic Spawn Countdown Timer

### Stupid
- Rat messages
- Dumb random messages at an interval

### Why
Friends asked for some features that they couldn't easily find in other mods. Wanted a challenge. Decided to make this.
But of course I decided to have some fun with it and added my own dumb features
